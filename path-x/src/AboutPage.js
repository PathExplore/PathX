					<h2>How The Idea Came to Life</h2>
					<p>
						As a high schooler, I’ve spent countless hours scouring the internet
						for opportunities like internships, competitions, summer programs,
						and volunteering experiences. It was frustrating to find that many
						of the best resources were hidden behind paywalls or scattered
						across dozens of websites, making the process overwhelming and
						time-consuming. I realized that if I was struggling to find these
						opportunities, other students probably were too. That’s when the
						idea for PathX was born — a free, one-stop platform designed to make
						it easy for high schoolers to discover and access high-quality
						opportunities all in one place. I wanted to create something that
						would save students the stress and hassle I went through, empowering
						them to explore their passions and build their futures without
						barriers. PathX is my way of giving back and making sure no student
						has to navigate this journey alone.
